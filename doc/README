COMMANDS (/bin DIRECTORY)
-------------------------

mirror
	quick frontend for rsync: duplicates verbatim one directory
	to destination

oldest
	recursively search the oldest (or the newest) file in a directory

non_blocking_dd
	same as dd bs=1, but doesn't block (I developed this util to
	patch a bug in some xen kernels that hangs reading /proc/kmsg)

7z-rmo
	small bash script that emulates "zip -rmo" behaviour, but on 7z
	files (archive files, set resulting compressed file timestamp the
	same of the newer file archived, and removes input files)

ddtime
	small perl script that emulates a basic 'dd' util, showing
	progress; developed when dd was lacking the progress feature,
	still usable (ie: to fill files with random patterns)

dug
	calls disk usage on args, summarizing and sorting results, and
	printing them in human readable format

fast_fingerprint
	computes an MD5 fingerprint using only a small selection of file
	blocks, usefull for fingerprinting very large files; used by
	xlocate and fdupe utils

fdupe
	find duplicate files and perform commands on them

ftpsync
	cli based ftp server/client sync util

ku-autosync
	sync filesystems or block devices, 
ku-compressdir
ku-dusage
ku-mediainfo
ku-storicize
ku-timestamp-rename
kupurge
kupurge-fast
mirror

COMMANDS (/sbin DIRECTORY)
-------------------------

blocksync
	sync block device from local to remote

ku-ext3-to-ext4
	convert ext3 filesystem to ext4

ku-handle-removable-disk
ku-handle-removable-luks
	bash scripts to automatic mount/umount, and launch scripts on usb
	disk add/remove events; must be used with udev rules

lvusage
	human readable LVM2 partitions summary

verbatim_chown
verbatim_chgrp
	change owner (or groups) and restore original permissions if changed
	(bypass the standard chown behaviour, that resets suid flag on
	owner/group change)
